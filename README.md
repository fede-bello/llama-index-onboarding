# Invoice Reconciler
A LlamaIndex workflow-based system that extracts requirements from contact information and validates whether invoices match those requirements.

## Overview
This project uses LlamaIndex workflows to:

1. **Extract Requirements**: Parse contact information and extract structured requirements for invoicing
2. **Validate Invoices**: Check if invoices comply with the extracted requirements from their associated contacts
3. **Reconcile**: Report mismatches and provide insights on invoice compliance

## Architecture
Built with LlamaIndex Workflows for orchestration and OpenAI LLMs for intelligent extraction and validation tasks.
